for example i didnot know that when you acess the api endpoint 
from a browser you get a totally different human readable site

I am trying to learn Django and the REST framework 
so I can implement some basic endpoints for my current project. 
My main focus is to add a bulk insert function for a specific entity. 
During the process, I ended up creating a web application with a REST API that is Dockerized. 
This has been a great starting point and a helpful refresher of the basics
